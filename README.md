# Double-Layer-Multi-Resolution-Memory-Decoding-Model
For the publication of NECO-D-21-00056
Author: Xiwei She

To reproduce the results and plots in the paper, start from the script named "Synthetic_3_runningScript.m" to run the corresponding cases using the proposed memory decoding model.  
To startover with simulating new synthetic data, start from the script named "Synthetic_1_*_.m". 

The folder named "Results" is for storing all model output files.
The folder named "Synthetic_Input" is for storing all model input files.
The folder named "toolbox" contains all necessary MATLAB function script for running the entire memory decoding model.

In each folder, there is a sub-folder named "Paper Referenced".  It contains the input-output data we used in the manuscript of NECO-D-21-00056. 

Data of the rodent and human studies are available to readers upon request.
